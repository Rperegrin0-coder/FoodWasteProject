Embark on a mission to combat food wastage through the development of a web platform using Python with Flask and JavaScript. This project facilitates the distribution of surplus food from restaurants and food stores to charities. By implementing a real-time database with Firebase, I ensured efficient, swift, and reliable transactions between participants. Through carefully designed user interfaces, businesses can list surplus items at discounted prices, significantly reducing food waste. This initiative also enables restaurants to connect with local charities for food donations, promoting community involvement and sustainable practices.
